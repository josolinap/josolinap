# Interactive Web Terminal

This directory contains the files for a fully interactive web terminal. You can upload these files to a web host to make it live.

## How to Deploy to your GitHub Pages

1.  **Go to your hosting repository:** Navigate to your `josolinap/josolinap.github.io` repository on GitHub.
2.  **Upload the files:** Click on the "Add file" button and choose "Upload files".
3.  **Select the files:** Drag and drop all the files from this directory (`index.html`, `style.css`, and `script.js`) into the upload area.
4.  **Commit the files:** Add a commit message (e.g., "Deploy interactive terminal") and commit the changes directly to the `main` branch.

Once the files are uploaded, your new interactive terminal will be live at your `https://josolinap.dedyn.io/` domain. You can then link to it from your main profile `README.md`.
